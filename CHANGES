NEW IN VERSION 7
=====================================================================

- Added MPI support. Multithreaded run executes on all ranks.
  Problem size or data is not subdivided - the exact same problem
  is solved in parallel by all ranks. 


=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 6
=====================================================================

- Fixed small bug in calculate_micro_xs() function. Occasionally,
  the index returned would be the last nuclidegridpoint for that
  nuclide, causing the "high" energy point to be off the end of the
  grid (likely into the next nuclide's energy grid). Added a check
  to correct for when this occurs.

  Note that this bug did not affect performance - only made the
  calculation of XS's more "correct".

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 5
=====================================================================

- Added ChangeLog

- Moved source code files to src/ directory.

- Updated README.txt file to enhance documentation

- Added significant documentation with regards to theory
  in the docs/XSBench_Theory.pdf file. The README.txt file is now
  more of a quick-start & users guide, whereas the XSBench_Theory.pdf
  guide covers the details and theory behind the code.
