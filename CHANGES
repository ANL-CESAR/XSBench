NEW IN VERSION 9
=====================================================================

- Added in new code verification mode. This can be toggled on in
the makefile. When code is compiled and run, a hash of the results
will be generated which can then be compared to other versions and
configurations of XSBench. See readme for more details.

- Moved PAPI def to makefile. Makes it easier to toggle.

- Added -l command line option to set the number of cross section
lookups performed by XSBench.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 8
=====================================================================

- Simplified command line interface (CLI) read in process. XSBench
now supports a more traditional CLI, as follows:

Usage: ./XSBench <options>
Options include:
  -n <threads>     Number of OpenMP threads to run
    -s <size>        Size of H-M Benchmark to run (small, large, XL)
	  -g <gridpoints>  Number of gridpoints per isotope
	  Default is equivalent to: -s large

- Updated README with new CLI usage details.

- Fixed several typos in the XSBench Theory PDF.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 7
=====================================================================

- Added MPI support. Multithreaded run executes on all ranks.
  Problem size or data is not subdivided - the exact same problem
  is solved in parallel by all ranks. Only MPI communication is
  a single reduce at the end to aggregate timing data. 
  
  To enable MPi mode, simply change the MPI flag in the makefile
  to "MPI = yes". Make sure mpicc is available on your system.

- Added in "XL" size option for a giant 277 GB energy grid. This
  is unlikely to fit on a single node, but is useful for
  experimentation purposes.

- Removed "BGQ mode" CLI argument option, as it wasn't being used
  by anything in the code anymore.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 6
=====================================================================

- Fixed small bug in calculate_micro_xs() function. Occasionally,
  the index returned would be the last nuclidegridpoint for that
  nuclide, causing the "high" energy point to be off the end of the
  grid (likely into the next nuclide's energy grid). Added a check
  to correct for when this occurs.

  Note that this bug did not affect performance - only made the
  calculation of XS's more "correct".

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 5
=====================================================================

- Added ChangeLog

- Moved source code files to src/ directory.

- Updated README.txt file to enhance documentation

- Added significant documentation with regards to theory
  in the docs/XSBench_Theory.pdf file. The README.txt file is now
  more of a quick-start & users guide, whereas the XSBench_Theory.pdf
  guide covers the details and theory behind the code.
