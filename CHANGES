NEW IN VERSION 16
=====================================================================
- (Feature) Added in an alternative XS lookup algorithm (known
  as the logarithmic hash-based lookup), that has recently been
  adopted by OpenMC and MCNP. This can be selected via the
  "-G hash" command line argument. Additionally, the number of
  hash bins can be set with the "-h <# hash bins>" argument, with
  a default of 10,000.

  The hash algorithm is much more memory efficient than the
  unionized energy (UEG) grid algorithm that is default in
  XSBench, while providing comparable speed to the UEG. More
  details regarding the hash algorithm are available in:
  
  Forrest B Brown. New hash-based energy lookup algorithm for monte
  carlo codes. Trans. Am. Nucl. Soc., 111:659â€“662, 2014.

  As compared to the UEG algorithm, the basic idea of the hash
  algorithm is that the acceleration grid no longer points to the
  exact indices in the nuclide energy grids, but rather indicates
  a small range in the nuclide grids where the appropriate data is
  found. While in the UEG method the nuclide data can be accessed
  directly, with the hash grid a binary search will still need to 
  be performed in the range indicated by the acceleration grid.
  This is still efficient however, as with enough hash bins, the area
  in the nuclide grid being searched is small so the binary search
  will be very fast.

  One important thing to note is that the energy levels in XSBench
  are stored in terms of lethargy, so no call to log() is necessary
  when hashing into the energy grid as would be the case in OpenMC.
  However, this call is not expensive as compared to the high
  latency and bandwidth requirements for accessing the XS data, so
  it is not expected to be substantial that lethargy is used instead
  of regular energy.

  We tested the new algorithm on a Skylake 8180 system (dual socket,
  with 56 cores and 112 threads total), and adjusted the number
  of hash bins to determine the optimal default setting. We found
  our results to be similar to those of Brown, with about 10,000
  hash bins resulting in good performance while only adding around
  10 MB of additional data on top of the basic nuclide grid data.
  Performance was good, and was only about 10% slower than the UEG,
  while being 2.38x faster than the nuclide grid search alone. In
  summary, on the architecture tested, the UEG is still the fastest
  algorithm but the hash algorithm provides only a 10% performance
  decrease but at the benefit of only using about 200 MB compared
  to 5,678 MB that the UEG method uses.

  We also tested two versions of the hash lookup algorithm, one
  where a binary search O(log(n)) is performed on the specified
  range in the nuclide grids, and a second version where a regular
  iterative search O(n) is performed. The reason for testing is
  that if the search range is low enough (e.g., less than 8),
  for hardware reasons it may be better to simply iterate through
  rather than jumping around out of order as would be done with
  the binary search. We found that the iterative algorithm was
  much slower when there were few hash bins (as would be expected).
  For higher numbers of hash bins, the iterative algorithm was
  usually competitive with the binary one, but any small benefits
  in performance (at best a few percent) were outweighed by the
  significant performance losses when only a few bins were
  present. So, for these reasons, the hash lookup algorithm in
  XSBench always does binary searches on the nuclide grids.

NEW IN VERSION 15
=====================================================================
- Improved the method by which the unionized energy grid (UEG) is
  initialized. Considering the following input parameters:
    - N_gp = Number of energy grid points each nuclide has
    - N_nuc = Number of nuclides in the simulation
  the old algorithm was: O(N_gp * N_nuc^2 * log2(N_gp))
  the new algorithm is : O(N_gp * N_nuc^2)
  In serial, the initialzation phase of the program runs
  about 10x faster than it did in version 14. However, as the new
  function results in false sharing issues in the UEG, it is not
  parallelized so can still take a significant portion of runtime
  when the code is run in parallel with high thread counts. On
  all machines I tested, I found that the new serial method at
  worst ran in the same walltime as the old parallel method.
  When doing performance analysis, it is still recommended to
  use higher XS lookup counts (as specified with the "-l" argument)
  to wash out time spent in this initialization phase.
- Removed the binary_search() function, as it is no longer used in
  initialization due to the improvement listed above.
- Added a warning to the program output to not profile the
  initialization region of the code. By default, if running on a
  powerful node with a high core count, the majority of the runtime
  of the code with default settings may be spent in the initialization
  phase, which will result in confusing or misleading performance
  characteristics. It is therefore not recommended to profile the
  initialization phase of the code, and to only profile the simulation
  region of the code. If that is not practical, it is recommended to
  use higher XS lookup counts (as specified with the "-l" argument)
  to wash out time spent in initialization.
- The above changes in version 15 have no performance impacts at all
  on the simulation region of the code. The changes only improve
  the speed of initialization to serve as a "quality of life"
  improvement for those running the code.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 14
=====================================================================
- (Feature) Added in the ability to only use a nuclide grid via the
  "-G nuclide" command line argument. This stops the code from
  allocating and initializing the unionized energy grid, which
  significantly reduces the amount of memory required. However,
  lookups are much slower in this mode as now a binary search must
  be performed for all nuclides for each macroscopic XS lookup
  (instead of only once per macro XS lookup). This feature was added
  as there was some interest in performance testing for this type
  of lookup method.
- Slight refactoring of arguments for the lookup functions to
  specify the new grid type option.
- Documentation was added for the new -G grid type command line
  argument.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 13
=====================================================================
- (Feature) Added in the ability for XSBench to write out a binary
  file containing a randomized XS dataset. The code is also capable
  of reading in this file instead of generating a new XS dataset
  each time the program is run. This feature may be useful for those
  running in simulation environments where walltime minimization
  is key for logistical reasons.

- Minor refactoring/reorganization of code to make the code clearer
  and easier to read. After many updates, the code had become a
  little bloated and difficult to read, so a cleanup was in order.

- Removed synthetic delay injection (via dummy FLOPS or loads).
  These were not very useful or accurate and had not been used by
  anyone after the initial analyses were done with them. As they were
  definitely adding to the code bloat of the program, they were
  removed.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 12
=====================================================================
- (Bugfix) The XL and XXL runtime options didn't work correctly.
  The unionized energy grid overflowed the bounds of normal 4 byte
  integers, and actually required use of 8 byte integers.

  The variables "n_isotopes" and "n_gridpoints" have been refactored
  to 8 byte long integers. All variables that use n_isotopes and
  n_gridpoints as input have also been refactored to 8 byte longs.

  Note that a simple "patch" from version 11 to version 12 can be
  manually done by simply changing line 73 of GridInit.c to be a
  long instead of an int. The more thorough refactoring done in v12
  is done to "future proof" the code.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 11
=====================================================================

- Updated & greatly improved the PAPI capability of XSBench. Now
  events can be tallied during multi-core. See README for more
  info.

- Added in option for thread sleep pause in between macro XS lookups.
  Very similar to adding dummy flops, but a little cleaner.
  
  With as small as a 0.1 ms sleep, we get linear scaling with threads.
  While this initially appears to confirm our initial suspicions
  regarding memory contention / latency problems, I think the delays
  resulting from the sleeps could potentially just be washing out
  the scaling numbers. Even with just 0.1, over 15 million lookups,
  the majority of the runtime (>90%) is just sleep, so scaling numbers
  aren't very expressive anymore. Need to implement timers that
  ignore the sleep parts.

- Specified OpenMP schedule mode as 'dynamic'. This is the default
  on most systems, but now it's set explicitly since it's a lot
  faster than 'static' or other modes.

- Added in a "benchmarking" mode, which will attempt all possible
  thread combinations between 1 <= nthreads <= max_threads.
  This helps to save considerable benchmarking time, as the
  data structures can be re-used between runs rather than regenerated
  each time. Benchmarking mode is enabled in the makefile.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 10
=====================================================================

- Changed verification mode to be more portable. The verification
strategy introduced in version 9 had discrepancies on different
platforms and compilers. This was due to reliance on the compiler
provided rand() function producing a different series of random
numbers than other implementations. Also, there were some issues
with the associativity of floating point arithmetic. These issues
have now all been solved, and the verification hash is consistent
across all tested platforms.

- Revised "XL" size parameters, as well as adding in an "XXL" size
option. The XL size now uses 120GB of XS data. The XXL mode uses
252GN of XS data. More details are in the verification section of the
readme. 

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 9
=====================================================================

- Added in new code verification mode. This can be toggled on in
the makefile. When code is compiled and run, a hash of the results
will be generated which can then be compared to other versions and
configurations of XSBench. See readme for more details.

- Moved PAPI def to makefile. Makes it easier to toggle.

- Added -l command line option to set the number of cross section
lookups performed by XSBench.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 8
=====================================================================

- Simplified command line interface (CLI) read in process. XSBench
now supports a more traditional CLI, as follows:

Usage: ./XSBench <options>
Options include:
  -n <threads>     Number of OpenMP threads to run
    -s <size>        Size of H-M Benchmark to run (small, large, XL)
	  -g <gridpoints>  Number of gridpoints per isotope
	  Default is equivalent to: -s large

- Updated README with new CLI usage details.

- Fixed several typos in the XSBench Theory PDF.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 7
=====================================================================

- Added MPI support. Multithreaded run executes on all ranks.
  Problem size or data is not subdivided - the exact same problem
  is solved in parallel by all ranks. Only MPI communication is
  a single reduce at the end to aggregate timing data. 
  
  To enable MPi mode, simply change the MPI flag in the makefile
  to "MPI = yes". Make sure mpicc is available on your system.

- Added in "XL" size option for a giant 277 GB energy grid. This
  is unlikely to fit on a single node, but is useful for
  experimentation purposes.

- Removed "BGQ mode" CLI argument option, as it wasn't being used
  by anything in the code anymore.

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 6
=====================================================================

- Fixed small bug in calculate_micro_xs() function. Occasionally,
  the index returned would be the last nuclidegridpoint for that
  nuclide, causing the "high" energy point to be off the end of the
  grid (likely into the next nuclide's energy grid). Added a check
  to correct for when this occurs.

  Note that this bug did not affect performance - only made the
  calculation of XS's more "correct".

=====================================================================
NEW IN VERSION 5
=====================================================================

- Added ChangeLog

- Moved source code files to src/ directory.

- Updated README.txt file to enhance documentation

- Added significant documentation with regards to theory
  in the docs/XSBench_Theory.pdf file. The README.txt file is now
  more of a quick-start & users guide, whereas the XSBench_Theory.pdf
  guide covers the details and theory behind the code.
